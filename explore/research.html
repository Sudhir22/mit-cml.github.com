Tissenbaum, M., Sheldon, J., & Abelson, H. (2019). From Computational Thinking to Computational Action. Communications of the ACM, March 2019, Vol. 62 No. 3, Pages 34-36.
<br />
<p>Abstract: Computational action, a new framing for computing education, proposes that while learning about computing, young people should also have opportunities to create with computing that have direct impact on their lives and their communities. In this Viewpoint, we outline two key dimensions of computational action—computational identity and digital empowerment—and further argue that by focusing on computational action in addition to computational thinking, we can make computing education more inclusive, motivating, and empowering for young learners. Learners have the capacity to develop computational products that can have authentic impact in their lives from the moment they begin learning to code, all they need is to be situated in contexts that allow them to do so.
</p>
<p>Too often, K-12 computing education has been driven by an emphasis on kids learning the "fundamentals" of programming. Even more progressive CS education that centers around the development of learners' computational thinking has largely focused on learners understanding the nuanced elements of computation, such as variables, loops, conditionals, parallelism, operators, and data handling.10 This initial focus on the concepts and processes of computing, leaving real-world applications for "later" runs the risk of making learners feel that computing is not important for them to learn. It begs the question far too many math or physics students have asked, "When will we use this in our lives?"

Abstract: Development of Computational Thinking (CT) is an area of many initiatives in the last years, due to the importance of having CT skills. There are many environments that allow learners to develop such skills, for instance Scratch and MIT App Inventor, in a visual and intuitive way. As in professional software development, assisting tools that help and guide learners are starting to appear. In this paper, we discuss the current status of these tools, based on an analysis of what state-of-the-art CT assessment tools, such as Dr. Scratch for Scratch and CodeMaster for App Inventor, offer. We report their limitations and envision and discuss future enhancements.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of everyday devices connected over the internet, know generally as the Internet of Things (IoT), has opened up new avenues for students to explore their worlds and think and create computationally.
Combining IoT with mobile technologies (such as smartphones), enables students to move their designs and computational thinking out of traditional classroom settings and into the real world. This article outlines a design-based IoT curriculum that connects Taiwanese students with the personally-relevant issue of air pollution. The curriculum employs student-driven smartphone application design, using MIT's App Inventor, with Wi-Fi enabled IoT devices (LinkIt 7697
Wi-Fi/BLE MCU board). This paper reports on changes to the curriculum based on a preliminary pilot and observations of student engagement during the most recent enactment.

<li>L. Tang. <strong>“Constrained Sets: The Effects of Multi-Layered Environments in Learning App Inventor”</strong>  term paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June 2018
Abstract: MIT App Inventor is a mobile application development platform that seeks to democratize the construction of mobile apps by making app development accessible to people with little to no experience with script-based programming. It uses block-based programming to introduce and teach programming concepts to its users. Users drag and drop functional and visual components onto their planned app in the screen editor, and construct the logic behind those components by using blocks in the block editor. In this thesis, we design and implement Constrained Sets, a system that allows instructors and developers to allow access to only a subset of App Inventor functionality by hiding component and block access. This system allows for the construction of multi-layered interfaces, which we then use to conduct an experiment that explores how novice App Inventor users learn App Inventor in different interface environments. Furthermore, we discuss and test the possibility of using a React based implementation of the App Inventor designer, and what implications that may have on creating more flexible user interfaces.

Abstract: App Inventor is an intuitive, blocked-based programming environment that allows everyone—even children—to build fully functional mobile apps for smartphones and tablets. App Inventor has been around for 8 years now, has users in almost every country in the world, and has 6.8 million users across the globe.
App Inventor democratizes mobile development through block-based coding, but because App Inventor targets only the Android operating system, this excludes the 20% of people worldwide who use Apple devices, including schools that are deploying iPads for use in the classroom. In this project, we’ve extended MIT App Inventor by natively developing components for iOS in Swift, allowing for the development of iOS applications through block-based programming. This provides users with the ability to develop Android and iOS versions of the same application, without any additional coding and without the need for platform-specific development hardware. Upon randomly sampling 1,831,065 existing App Inventor projects, 68.805% of the projects could be developed for both iOS and Android. This solution takes great steps toward democratizing cross-platform mobile development for Android and iOS applications.

Abstract: AppInventor allows anyone, even - and especially - children, to create fully functional apps in a quick and trouble-free way. AppInventor+IoT expands this to include communication between the device running the app and remote devices, most notably Arduinos. The next step with AppInventor+IoT is to allow for fully autonomous projects to run on the Arduino. This is what the ​App Inventor IoT Embedded Companion (hereafter Embedded Companion) makes possible. While this was in development, I ​created project tutorials to complement the addition of the EmbeddedCompanion into AppInventor+IoT. I made tutorials for two projects, the Autonomous Healthy Plant and the Puzzle Box, to showcase the power of autonomously-run projects. I also made slight adjustments to the existing how-to documents for setting up the Arduino and setting up a BLE connection between the app and the Arduino. Since the EmbeddedCompanion was in development while I was building the tutorials, I extended device functionality to meet the needs of these two projects: light sensor, humidity and temperature
sensor, moisture sensor, touch sensor, buzzer, and LCD.

Abstract: CloudDB, an experimental feature of the MIT App Inventor Platform, allows users to send data across several different machines using tag (descriptor) and value (data) pairs. However, currently with CloudDB, users, by deploying several blocks, can only view specific values corresponding to known tags. Since App Inventor, a blocks-based app development interface, emphasizes the usability of its program, in this work I implement a web interface where users can view and search the entirety of their CloudDB data history. The user, for each separate project, can see their tags, the corresponding stored data, and a
history of that data. Detailed user studies were conducted to discover efficacy in teaching shared data concepts using this tool. Coupled with educational workshops designed for increasing computational thinking, this extension of CloudDB helps bolster student comprehension of advanced computing concepts and strengthen their independence in design, development, and debugging processes. This work demonstrates that a comprehensive visual tool appended
to a cloud database system can increase understanding and thinking about a technology so prevalent in many of today’s technologies. <br/>

Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2017 IEEE, 1705-1708, April 2017
<br>
Abstract: While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.

Abstract: As digital technology is increasingly a part of all sectors of society, educational approaches must be developed in order to nurture students’ ability to see the world through a computational lens. One way to achieve this goal is to promote Computational Thinking (CT) for young learners. The CoolThink@JC project is a four-year curriculum pilot designed to integrate CT into Hong Kong upper-primary level schools. The CoolThink framework for curriculum development is structured around computational concepts, practices and perspectives adapted from the framework of Brennan and Resnick (2012). This adapted framework motivated the choice of learning activities for CoolThink. This paper focuses on one aspect of that framework, namely computational practices. Here, we describe how activities in the CoolThink curriculum can promote the computational practices highlighted by the framework.

<br />
Abstract: To understand computational thinking in App Inventor, it is important to be able to effectively evaluate computational complexity in block-based programming languages. In the past, there have been a handful of complexity measures proposed for text-based languages (Weyuker, 1988). In this paper, we will attempt to implement 2 such measures, Halstead’s Programming Effort and statement count, in App Inventor on a dataset of projects from 50 random users. The goal is to determine whether or not text programming standards for complexity can be generalized to block programming languages. This paper shows that the 2 complexity measures we implemented are not adequate measures for complexity in App Inventor. This result indicates a need for different measures of complexity that more accurately portray block programming proficiency. We hope this study will be a gateway into a better understanding of the intricacies of App Inventor’s block programming language and its unique contributions to the development of computational thinking.

<br />
Abstract: A global push to broaden participation in computer science has led to an explosion of interest in blocks-based programming. Visual blocks are used by numerous programming tools.  Millions of students receive their first exposure to programming via these tools in courses and activities like Code.org’s Hour of Code. Blocks allow beginners to compose programs without struggling with the frustrations of syntax (Figure 1).  
There is increasing interest in developing and studying blocks languages. At VL/HCC 2015, a small workshop session called Blocks and Beyond ballooned to a large event, with 51 submissions and 36 presenters. Researchers shared work in new blocks languages, interface innovations, domain-specific applications of blocks, and ways to make blocks languages more effective and accessible for diverse coders.
This article explores how blocks impact the learnability of programming.  We begin by reviewing studies on the effectiveness of blocks languages.  Then we discuss the key features of blocks languages and how they relate to learning. Finally, we look at applications of blocks in new domains and discuss tools for creating your own blocks language.

Abstract: This paper discusses the opportunities presented by the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide youth opportunities to develop their computational thinking and digital empowerment. This paper argues that to support youth in developing these literacies, we need to develop platforms that reduce the barriers of entry while still allowing them to explore and develop their computational identities. To this end, this paper introduces an extension to App Inventor by MIT that enables students to quickly design, develop, and implement IoT applications. We outline one IoT activity for youth and future directions for both curricular and technical development.

<br />
Abstract: As technology and society become further intertwined, it is imperative that we democratize the creation of technology and educate people to be capable of harnessing the full power of computational thinking. As such, developing meaningful tools and curricula for incremental learning of computational thinking concepts starting in primary education is an important endeavor [1]. My work focuses on making Cloud technology, one of the most powerful new computer science concepts, understandable and usable by anyone without the need for extensive computer science training.
I used MIT App Inventor, a blocks-based mobile application development tool for teaching computational thinking to young students, as the platform for my research. I developed CloudDB, a set of coding blocks for MIT App Inventor that allows users to store, retrieve, and share various types of data in tag-value pairs on a Redis server for their mobile applications. I created middle and high school level curricula based on CloudDB along with assessment tools to evaluate my materials and the extent to which young students can understand and utilize the concepts around shared data.  Finally, I ran one of those workshops with middle school students in the MIT area.
My findings indicate that teaching shared data as a core computational thinking concept is entirely feasible to students as young as middle school level.  Students are capable of inferring and extrapolating other use cases and potential problems with the Cloud, such as storage limits and security concerns.  When given the context of solving a problem in their lives, they are very driven and able to design and create complex independent mobile application projects using MIT App Inventor and CloudDB.

<br />
Abstract: Collaboration becomes increasingly important in programming as projects become more complex. With traditional text-based programming languages, programmers typically use a source code management system to manage the code, merge code from multiple authors, and optionally lock files for conflict-free editing. There is a limited corpus of work around collaborative editing of code in visual programming languages such as block-based programming. I present a collaborative programming environment to MIT App Inventor, a web-based visual platform for building Android applications with blocks, which enables many programmers to collaborate in real time on the same MIT App Inventor project. I design and implement three collaboration models to evaluate the efficacy of these different collaborative models for users of App Inventor so as to understand which approach best enables collaboration. Our results demonstrate that real-time programming decreases the completion time of a task, improves the interaction between users, and increases users’ likeability towards collaborative programming. I anticipate that this new collaborative programming environment will change the way users use MIT App Inventor, and more curriculum based on the collaborative tools will be designed.

The component initially provided key-value storage and basic list operations. I improved it by adding advanced list operations, image, sound and other media file storage, as well as ensuring that data stored on the server would be transmitted securely to and from user devices via SSL.

Abstract: App Inventor is a website that allows users to make their own Android apps using a block-based coding language.  While App Inventor has almost 3 million users, it contains few accessibility features. In particular, there is no way for a user to navigate the block workspace on the App Inventor site without using their mouse; this poses a significant problem for users who use screen readers or who cannot operate a mouse. I have designed and implemented a set of keyboard shortcuts that allow users to operate the App Inventor website in an intuitive way. I have also conducted a usability study to determine the effectiveness of this keyboard-accessible interface. Based on the results of the study, I conclude that much of the interface is intuitive to users with experience using the keyboard in other domains, but that there are changes that can be made to make the design even more intuitive.

<br />
Abstract: MIT App Inventor is an open source web platform that lets users build their own Android Apps quickly by using blocks-based programming. MIT App Inventor currently has diverse types of components, from general blocks to specific task oriented components like sensors. However, it does not provide every type of block that an user needs. For example, currently there are no components for intricate graph visualization in App Inventor. However, there is a limitation to keep adding new categories of blocks, not only because the complexity of maintaining the system will increase, but also because an individual user’s need is necessarily not a general need for others. In order to keep lowering the barriers of creating special goal oriented apps and to foster the learning of computational thinking, while also preventing the situation of adding every possible block to the system, a new feature called “user-defined blocks (customizable blocks)” has been implemented during 2017 Spring semester.

Abstract: My research investigates the following question:​­ ​How can relief workers be empowered to create useful mobile apps to support the work of first responder teams? Mobile devices are reshaping the disaster management domain and they make fast and targeted support possible.  However there is the major obstacle of relief workers and volunteers often lacking the technical abilities to build and deploy the right mobile app in response to a particular disaster. In addition, data interoperability is often missing in many of the applications since they were developed without any prior agreement on the data schema. Linked Data technology solves the data interoperability problem by defining a method of publishing structured data and these structured data can be interlinked and become more useful. In order to explore and provide a solution to the gap between the knowledge of the relief workers and volunteers and the technical abilities needed to
create an app, I conducted a participatory design workshop with the people at the International Committee of Red Cross and developed two mobile applications with one of the project managers there. In addition, I have created a Do­It­Yourself (DIY) toolkit that includes: (1) a Mobile Linked Data App Kit: a streamlined process for creating mobile apps and (2) an app­building methodology: a set of principles for relief workers to follow while creating apps using the toolkit.  The goal of this toolkit is to enable aid workers to create vital and necessary mobile apps and to empower the humanitarian community. User testing of the framework with first responders has shown that the idea of “using, modifying, and creating” an app is greatly favored by our
participants, that mobile Linked Data applications can aid humanitarian organizations by increasing their impact and effectiveness, and that humanitarian workers can successfully develop
and deploy mobile applications by using this toolkit.

<li>A. Colter, <strong>“Evaluating and improving the usability of MIT App Inventor,” 
</strong> M.Eng. thesis, Elect. Eng. Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, 2016.
<br />
Abstract: MIT App Inventor is a blocks-based programming language for Android apps designed to teach programming skills to middle school and high school students. We aim to make app development accessible for all. Anyone learning to program must learn computational thinking methods; App Inventor users must also learn how to use the service. Our target users, teenagers and people without programming experience, often conflate the two learning processes: they think App Inventor is hard because learning to program is hard. As such, App Inventor needs a
user interface that matches the conventions of commercially- available software our users already know how to use. Such an interface will allow them to focus on learning how to program and to transfer their knowledge and skills to other programming languages and environments.
I designed several tasks and conducted a usability study on the existing, publicly- available App Inventor service. Users encountered 75 unique issues and a total of 157 issues. This is an average of 5 unique issues and 10.5 total issues per user. I made changes to the App Inventor source code that addressed 34 of the most common issues encountered. My intent was to make App Inventor both more usable to novice programmers and more similar to the programming environments that experienced programmers use. Finally, I conducted a usability
study with the same tasks on the modified version of App Inventor. Users encountered 65 unique issues, including 19 issues encountered in the first study, and 107 total issues. Based on user
comments and behavior, I conclude that my solutions resolved 21 of the original issues, partially mitigated 9 issues, and did not improve the usability of 4 issues.

<li>B. Xie, <strong>“Progression of computational thinking skills demonstrated by App Inventor users,” </strong> M.Eng thesis, Elect. Eng. Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, 2016.
<br />
Abstract: I analyze skill progression in MIT App Inventor, an open, online learning environment
with over 4.7 million users and 14.9 million projects/apps created. My objective is to
understand how people learn computational thinking concepts while creating mobile
applications with App Inventor. In particular, I am interested in the relationship
between the development of sophistication in using App Inventor functionality and the
development of sophistication in using computational thinking concepts as learners
create more apps. I take steps towards this objective by modeling the demonstrated
sophistication of a user along two dimensions: breadth and depth of capability. Given
a sample of 10,571 random users who have each created at least 20 projects, I analyze
the relationship between demonstrating domain-specific skills by using App Inventor
functionality and generalizable skills by using computational thinking concepts.
<br />I cluster similar users and compare differences in using computational concepts.
My findings indicate a common pattern of expanding breadth of capability by
using new skills over the first 10 projects, then developing depth of capability by
using previously introduced skills to build more sophisticated apps. From analyzing
the clustered users, I order computational concepts by perceived complexity. This
concept complexity measure is relative to how users interact with components. I
also identify differences in learning computational concepts using App Inventor when
compared to learning with a text-based programming language such as Java. In
particular, statements (produce action) and expressions (produce value) are separate
blocks because they have different connections with other blocks in App Inventor’s
visual programming language. This may result in different perceptions of computational concepts when compared to perceptions from using a text-based programming language, as statements are used more frequently in App Inventor than expressions.
<br  />
This work has implications to enable future computer science curriculum to better
leverage App Inventor’s blocks-based programming language and events-based model
to offer more personalized guidance and learning resources to those who learn App
Inventor without an instructor.

<li>S. Tsai, <strong>“Understanding App Inventor forums,” </strong> M.Eng. thesis, Elect. Eng. Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, 2016.
<br />
Abstract: MIT App Inventor is a visual blocks language that allows users to create mobile applications for Android. App Inventor users have the option of posting in a public support forum to discuss anything from specific programming issues to education is- sues. In order to leverage the information on the forums to improve App Inventor, we must first understand what is being discussed. In this thesis, we used unsupervised machine learning methods to automate discovery of discussion topics. First, we transformed posts into feature vectors using a bag-of-words model. Next, we clustered posts using k-means clustering and evaluated our results both quantitatively, by calculating the average silhouette of the posts, and qualitatively, by simply looking at the clusters of posts. Finally, we used LDA topic modeling to determine the topics being discussed and compared the extracted topic words to a manual evaluation of each cluster. Using this technique, we were able to uncover common problems with App Inventor that users encountered. We hope to use this information to improve users’ experience with App Inventor.

<li>K. Asmus, <strong>“A system of applications for the integration of BLE beacons in museums,” </strong> M.Eng. thesis, Elect. Eng. Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, 2016.
<br />
Abstract: There is great potential for BLE beacon technology to be incorporated into museum exhibits to provide more enriching content to visitors and gather feedback to improve the museum overall. I developed a system of three applications to accomplish these goals: one for museum staff to easily deploy and update beacons, another for visitors to engage with the supplemental material transmitted by beacons at various exhibits, and a third for museum staff to understand visitors’ interactions and feedback provided by the beacons.
<br>
I implemented two versions of the system according to two different beacon protocols: Eddystone- UID, which broadcasts to a dedicated mobile app; and Eddystone-URL, which broadcasts to mobile browsers via the Physical Web.
<br>
Each system was tested in a real-world context through experiments hosted by the MIT Museum. I analyzed the success and potential of such systems based on observations, participant responses, and data gathered via the system during the experiments. The reliability of BLE connections remains an issue, and beacon content only appealed to a small subset of visitors; however, those who interacted with the system valued the experience highly and the MIT Museum expressed interest in providing a richer experience for these visitors.

<br />Abstract: MIT App Inventor is a web service that enables users with little to no previous programming experience to create mobile applications using a visual blocks language. We analyze a sample of 5,228 random projects from the corpus of 9.7 million and group projects by functionality. We then use the number of unique blocks in projects as a metric to better understand the usability and realized capability of using App Inventor to implement specific functionalities. We introduce the notion of a usability score and our results indicate that introductory tutorials heavily influence the usability of App Inventor to implement particular functionalities. Our findings suggest that the sequential nature of App Inventor's learning resources results in users realizing only a portion of App Inventor's capabilities and propose improvements to these learning resources that are transferable to other programming environments and tools.

<br />Abstract: The Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) project is an NSF-funded CS 10K project. Its goal is to train a new cohort of high school computer science teachers to teach an Advanced Placement (AP) level course based on the emerging Computer Science Principles (CSP) framework. Mobile CSP uses App Inventor, a graphical programming language for Android devices, to engage students in app building as
a means to get them interested in computer science. This paper reports on the first year of this effort. In addition to describing the project’s Professional Development (PD) course, a 6-week, full-time summer course for teachers, and the Mobile CSP curriculum, the paper provides a preliminary analysis of demographic and performance data obtained from high school students who took the course during the 2013-2014 academic year.

Abstract: With the Advent of “smart” mobile phones and ubiquitous mobile applications, the pace at which people generate, access, and acquire data has accelerated significantly. In this thesis, we first examine how privacy concerns in the mobile apps market compromise the well-being of both app consumers and developers. Then, we study the problem with the lack of usable privacy documents in mobile apps. Subsequently, we propose a technical solution named PrivacyInformer, as an extension to the MIT App Inventor, a do-it-yourself mobile app building platform. This platform has a vast international user base, as well as a growing impact on the democratizing of mobile app building. We show that by analyzing the source code of mobile apps, PrivacyInformer can produce simple and useful privacy descriptions in both human-readable and machine-readable format. Finally, we conduct an exploratory user study to evaluate the effectiveness of PrivacyInformer from the app developer's perspective, as well as discuss the policy impact of such a tool in the mobile app development community.

<br />Abstract: MIT App Inventor is a programming environment that lowers the barriers to creating mobile apps for Android devices, especially for people with little or no programming experience. App Inventor apps for a mobile device are constructed by arranging components with a WYSIWYG editor in a computer web browser, where the development computer is connected to the device by WiFi or USB.  The behavior of the components is specified using a blocks-based graphical programming language. A key feature in making App Inventor accessible to beginning programmers is live programming: Developers interact directly with the state of the evolving program as it is being constructed, and changes made in the web browser are realized instantaneously in the running app on the device. This paper describes the live programming features of App Inventor and explains how they are implemented.

Abstract: Smartphones have become the primary and most intimate computing devices that people rely on for their daily tasks. Sensor-based and network technologies have turned smartphones into a “context-aware” information hub and a vehicle for information exchange. These information provide apps and third party with a wealth of sensitive information to mine and profile user behavior. However, the Orwellian implications created by context-awareness technology have caused uneasiness to people when using smartphone applications and reluctance of using them [6]. To mitigate people’s privacy concerns, previous research suggests giving controls to people on how their information should be collected, accessed and shared. However, deciding who (people or the application) gets to access to what (types of information) could be an unattainable task. In order to develop appropriate applications and privacy policies it is important to understand under what circumstances people are willing to disclose information.

Abstract: We address the challenge of improving transparency for smartphone applications by creating tools that assesses privacy risk. Specifically, we invented a framework for qualitatively assessing and quantitatively measuring the intrusiveness of smartphone applications based on their data access behaviors. Our framework has two essential components. The first component is the Privacy Fingerprint, a novel visualization that is concise yet holistic. It captures each app's unique access patterns to sensitive personal data, including which types of behaviors and under which privacy-relevant usage contexts the data are collected. The second component is a new Intrusiveness Score that numerically measures out-of-context data collection, based on real data accesses gathered from empirical testing on 33 popular Android apps across 4 app categories. Specific attention is paid to the proportion of data accesses that occurs while the user is idle, raising the perceived level of intrusiveness and exposing the profiling potential of an app. Together, these components will help smartphone users decide whether to install an app because they will be able to easily and accurately assess the relative intrusiveness of apps. Our study also demonstrates that the Intrusiveness Score is helpful to compare apps that exhibit similar types of data accesses.

Abstract: In this thesis, I designed and built three sets of applications for three different demographics - young people, elderly people, and people in the developing world - to enable them to be involved in their personal banking. Members of these demographics are not actively involved in their personal banking when compared to others. We believe that part of the discrepancy lies in the lack of convenience and accountability. Thus, we have developed applications, whereby the issues of convenience and accountability are addressed. The applications are built around mobile devices, which will likely make them accessible since members of these demographics are often on mobile devices. The applications are also built around rules that can be set by a responsible party, so that the users know exactly what can and cannot be done with their money (such as a father restricting the amount of money his son can withdraw, or what the money can be used for). Finally, we keep a history of every transaction, who initiated it, and an explanation given by the initiator so we can understand why it occurred. Using our applications, built around convenience and accountability, will allow banks to reach youth, elderly people, and people in the developing world in ways that they have not been able to previously.

<li>A. Bhagi, <strong> “Android game development with App Inventor,” </strong> M.Eng. thesis, Elect. Eng. Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, 2012.<br />
Abstract: Ever since App Inventor found a new home at MIT's Center for Mobile Learning in early 2012 (it was previously housed at Google), it has been receiving significant attention from educational communities that hope to use the tool to facilitate technology learning in the classroom and beyond. 
Much of App Inventor's current user base is teachers in high-schools and colleges, and as the tool continues to attract more users, it is likely that many of these users will be teachers of students in grades 3 thru 12 (i.e. students who are old enough to know how to use computers and design/develop apps, yet not experienced enough to get their hands dirty with the Android SDK). Students of this age group are quite fond of gaming, and so we anticipate that there will be a strong demand for developing graphically appealing, interactive single-player and multiplayer games using App Inventor in the coming years. It is therefore important that the App Inventor team at MIT prepare for the imminent growth of the App Inventor game development community. Accordingly, this thesis looks at where App Inventor currently stands with respect to game development and how its game development capabilities can be improved and extended.<br />

<br />
Abstract: Building Blocks for Mobile Games is a client-server multiplayer game building framework for the App Inventor for Android platform. The framework includes an App Inventor component and a game server running on Google App Engine. The client side component packages the complexity of web service calls, data transfer and game state management into a set of graphical code blocks that allow users without programming experience to create Android applications that can access the game server API. The default game server provides basic functionality that can be used to create simple multiplayer games and message passing applications, such as a multi user bulletin board. By using custom server modules, the game server can be enhanced to provide server commands that implement a wide range of operations. Custom modules were used with the system to develop a multi- player card game, a version of Bulls and Cows with a shared scoreboard, an application that accesses Amazon’s book search API and a pair of applications for creating, managing and voting in polls. Using App Inventor and the game framework, each of these applications can be created with only a basic understanding of mobile phones and client-server principles.<br />
